## Hi People

My name is Gabriel, but I prefer been called Ellyzeul, my nickname and a pseudonym.

I don't know if I can call myself passionate about technology, but programming is both my work and my hobby.

## Interest areas

I like to study about, pretty much, anything about code, but recently I've been focusing on the distributed computing and functional programming.

### Fav Langs
I'd study some languages for work, for university and for personal interest, here are some of them:

  - I know that JS is a must know for every web dev, so it's no surprise to have it here, but I'd like to state that the right way to code JS is to code in TS haha.
- <img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/php/php-original.svg"> PHP
  - The language everyone loves to hate. I like the language, mainly because I work with PHP almost eveyday.
- <img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/elixir/elixir-original.svg"> Elixir
  - Elixir is a love of mine, I'm really into functional programming, although I'm not a specialist in the language, I plan to be.
- <img height="20" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/c/c-original.svg"> C (as my first learned lang, C has a special place in the heart)
  - For a long time I used to thing that I would rarely need to use C in my daily life, but gladly it turned out I was wrong. C is very versatile, gives you true power and performance, and it's indispensable when it comes to embedded.


### Final considerations
That's me.
