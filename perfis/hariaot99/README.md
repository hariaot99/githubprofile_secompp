### Hi there, hello from üáßüá∑!
I'm a software developer and computer science student focusing on learning the GNU/Linux üêß environment and programming in general. Already worked with TypeScript, Python, C, Rust ü¶Ä and concurrent/parallel programming. Currently exploring the web backend and the functional paradigm.

Tools I currently work with:
- [Prisma ORM](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) - created some aplicattions [\[1\]](https://github.com/salies/voxlog) mostly managed by this ORM, performing CRUD operations and running transactions (atomic queries).
- [Express.JS](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - TypeScript applications [\[1\]](https://github.com/salies/voxlog) using an MVC architecture, exporing the routes as an REST API.
- [Docker/Docker-Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose) - Created and deployed applications using docker-compose to deploy and coordinate their services (database, web front-end and the backend API). Also, I manage a home linux server providing applications as web services.
- [Rustlang](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) - Yeah, i'm repeating this. I really enjoyed this language. I made a huge improvement in a heavy and slow Python [image processing application](https://github.com/becelli/kayn) porting the critical logic to Rust, working with concurrency.
- Anything at all. I really enjoy constantly try new stuff. ~~i hope [Crystal](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal) works out.~~

Finally, I‚Äôm currently working on a last.fm alternative, [voxlog](https://github.com/salies/voxlog), and a [CG tool](https://github.com/becelli/computer-graphics).
